Red-Black Trees are self-balancing Binary Search Trees that ensure that search, insertion, and deletion operations for a tree with N nodes will take in the worst case in the order of log(N) steps. Red-Black Trees achieve this by regularly re-balancing the tree with the help of rotations after an insertion or deletion.

In this assignment, you will implement the Red-Black Tree insertion algorithm in a new, instantiable class that extends your BSTRotation class from P102. You are not required to implement the Red-Black Tree deletion algorithm.
